Mount Kailash is believed to be the centre of the universe. For years, Kailash Mansarovar has been attracting devotees from all over the world. The journey to Kailash Mansarovar has the ability to atone for our shortcomings and cleanse us of our sins. Sighting Mount Kailash once in a lifetime even from a distance is considered to give immense satisfaction to Bhole bhakts. According to the Hindu Mythology, the lake Mansarovar was first created by Lord Brahma in his mind, after which it was materialized on Earth. Thus in Sanskrit it is known as &lsquo;Manasarovar&rsquo; which is the combination of words &lsquo;Manasa Sarovaram&rsquo; which means &lsquo;mind&rsquo; and &lsquo;lake&rsquo;. The lake is also known for its summer abode for Hamsa or swan.

It is said that the Panch Kailash Yatra offers happiness, salvation, and spiritual release. Since these Panch Kailash are believed to be the&nbsp; five abodes of Lord Shiva it is said where there is Kailash there is Gauri kund which is also the bathing Kund of Mata Parvati signifying the togetherness of Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati.</p>

As per the Hindu Mythologies, the Kailash Parvat is the great mountain where Mahadev resides with Maa Parvati and other devta gan.\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe Kailash Mansarovar region has a distinctive scenic splendor, rich cultural legacy, and ethereal ambiance. Mount Kailash is believed to be the centre of the universe. For years, Kailash Mansarovar has been attracting devotees from all over the world. The journey to Kailash Mansarovar has the ability to atone for our shortcomings and cleanse us of our sins. Sighting Mount Kailash once in a lifetime even from a distance is considered to give immense satisfaction to Bhole bhakts. According to the Hindu Mythology, the lake Mansarovar was first created by Lord Brahma in his mind, after which it was materialized on Earth. Thus in Sanskrit it is known as \u0026lsquo;Manasarovar\u0026rsquo; which is the combination of words \u0026lsquo;Manasa Sarovaram\u0026rsquo; which means \u0026lsquo;mind\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;lake\u0026rsquo;.

Known as Parvati Kund, the natural pond/Kund near Kinnaur Kailash peak is believed to be created by Goddess Parvati. She worshipped here for a long time. It is also the meeting place of Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati. It was also the meeting place of Lord Shiva and the Goddess hence it was also known as \u0026quot;Aashiq Park\u0026quot;. The Kinner Kailash range in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh is located near the Indo-Tibetan border at an altitude of 17,200 feet above sea level. It is also one of the most remote and less explored regions of the stunningly scenic Himachal.
