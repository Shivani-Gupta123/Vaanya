temples&quot;</strong>, a celestial peak called Adi Kailash. Towering at a height of <strong>6,310 meters</strong>, this pious mountain in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand is a valuable jewel of the Kumaon Himalayas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also called Shiva Kailash, Baba Kailash, Chhota Kailash, and Jyolingkong Peak, it is an example of both pilgrimage and exploration. Spirituality begins with the beautiful village of Kutti, where people can enter this sacred place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through the <strong>14-kilometer trek</strong> to get to the base camp, feel the rejuvenating breath of the mountain air in your lungs. Along the way, you will visit the Gaurikund, a sacred place where Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati reside in a temple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hindus worldwide hold Adi Kailash in high esteem and it remains an example of the strength of faith and elegance of nature. Follow Trip to Temples and let us guide you through this spiritual journey that is closer with every step to the place of the gods.</p>
