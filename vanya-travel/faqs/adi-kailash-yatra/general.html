<p>Now in the most popular itinerary offered by Trip To Temples, Adi Kailash &amp; Om Parvat yatra is of 7Night 8 Days. It starts from Kathgodam and ends at Kathgodam.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1st day,</strong> we have Darshan of Neem Karoli Baba Ashram at Kainchi Dham, Chitai Golu Mandir &amp; the Jageshwar Dham. After Darshan, we reach Pithoragarh &amp; stay in a Rest houses</p>

Starting from Dharchula we cover villages and places like Dobat- Tawaghat- Pangla- Garbadhar- Lakhanpur- Najang- Malpa- Lamari-Budhi-Chialekh-Garbyang-Napalchu-Gunji<br />
<strong>4th Day,&nbsp;</strong>we start from Gunji and head towards the darshan of Adi Kailash to Jolingkong Base on 4th day. Although Adi Kailash is clearly visible from Jolingkong base. Those who are comfortable in small treks of 2-3 km can go uphills &amp; have a darshan of the holy Shiva Temple &amp; Parvati Sarovar and then further to Gauri Kund.

<p><strong>Spiritual Significance of Adi Kailash:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;It is believed that Rakshash Raj Ravan was Blessed by Ten heads, power and strength here in Adi Kailash after his intense Tapasya to impress Lord Shiva. It is believed that Pandavas and even Adi Shankaracharya visited Kailash Mansarovar via the same route and did Tapasya here. It is a blessing in itself to be able to walk on the same spiritual path on which many Rishis and Munis went. It is believed that Darshan of Adi Kailash can bring a new approach to your Life and purify your karmic cycle.</p>

<p><strong>OM Parvat</strong><br />
OM Parvat is One of the rare sights ever to have been found. One can find a natural image of OM being imprinted on OM mountain being beautifully highlighted by snow. According to Puranas, there are a total of eight such naturally existing structures of OM yet only one has been found that exists in the shared borders of three countries, Nepal China and India. As a matter of fact, the front face of OM can be witnessed only the from Indian side from Nabhidang Viewpoint(4300 metres).</p>

<p>OM Parvat is one of the rarest wonders of the world. OM&nbsp;is the sound of the Universe .It is revered and considered Holy word in Hinduism,Buddhism,Jainism. The Symbol of OM&nbsp;&nbsp;(ॐ) can be naturally witnessed and seen taking a shape in the mountain. It is built without any human intervention. One can witness the full honour of OM on clear weather. A sense of connectivity is experienced by people when they are in the region (Nabhidhang) looking at OM.&nbsp;Om parvat images and om parvat photos do look surreal when you look them on the internet and indeed it is something which looks out of the world. But OM parvat in Uttarakhand is 100% real and authentic.&nbsp;</p>
