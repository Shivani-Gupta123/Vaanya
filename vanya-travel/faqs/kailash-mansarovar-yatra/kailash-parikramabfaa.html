Do not be adamant about the parikrama, do it only if your health permits.\nThose who do not want to do Kailash Mountain Parikrama stay in Darchen or Purang (per the instructions of the Tibetan Guide) and wait for others to complete the Parikrama of Holy Kailash Parvat.&nbsp;\nOn the First day of Mount Kailash Parikrama, all the pilgrims go together till Yam Dwar and do the darshan of Mount Kailash and those who are not going ahead return to Darchen or Purang.\nOn the Second day of Mount Kailash Parikrama, they stay at the given hotel and take rest or get absorbed in the meditation of god.&nbsp;\nOn the third day, the Mount Kailash Parikrama gets complete and all the yatries meet by 9-10 a.m. and together proceed ahead.\nNowadays, many people who are very sure in advance that they are not going to complete the Parikrama of Shiva Kailash or have a lesser number of days, then they opt for the shortest Kailash Mansarovar Yatra route in just 5 days.\nFor more details SMS/ Whatsapp Short KMY on 8510007751.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the Mount Kailash parikrama total distance? How do we cover it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Parikrama of Mount Kailash is a total of 40 Kms which is covered in Two and a half days. You can cover this distance either on foot or on a pony. The Parikrama starts from Yamdwar - the place from where we get the darshan of Nandi Parvat and Kailash Parvat.\nOn Day 1, you will be covering 10km from Yamdwar to Dhirapuk. This is the most auspicious day of the Kailash Yatra because Mount Kailash is visible throughout the day. We get the best view of Mount Kailash from Dhirapuk between 2 mountains. We also get to see Silver Kailash at night and Golden Kailash in the morning from Dhirapuk.\nOn Day 2, you will be covering 22 km from Dhirapuk to Zuthulpuk. The 22km distance is divided into three parts- the first 6 km uphill, the next 6 km downhill and the last 10 km plain. We start early morning by 4 a.m. because the first stretch of 6 km (Dhirapuk to Dol Mala Pass) is the toughest part of Mount Kailash Parikrama and we try to complete it before the sun shines bright. The last 10 km is a beautiful stretch with the Karnali river flowing by the side.\nOn the last day, you will be covering 8km. It is a plain terrain that gets covered in 2 to 3 hours and with this, the Kailash Parikrama will be completed.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When can we see Golden or Silver Kailash?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We can see Golden Kailash in the morning during sunrise at Dhirapuk. The sunlight falling on the peak of Mount Kailash makes the white snow look golden. We can see Silver Kailash at night in Dhirapuk and Mansarovar Lake when moonlight falls on the peak of Mount Kailash, making the snow shine. The yatries reach Dhirapuk on the first day of Kailash Parikrama. We get to see the most beautiful view of Mount Kailash between two mountains in Dhirapuk.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where is Nandi Parvat located?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Nandi Parvat is located nearby Mount Kailash in Tibet. It is said that wherever Lord Shiva is, Nandi Ji is also present there as a gatekeeper. It is situated just below the South face of Mount Kailash. The Nandi Parvat is a matter of surprise because such a creation at this height cannot be manmade. It is clearly visible from Yam Dwar.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where do we see Gauri Kund during the Mount Kailash Parikrama? Can I bring Gauri Kund water with me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Gauri Kund is a place of great importance for the Hindus. It is said that Lord Ganesha was born here out of froth and lather derived formed when Mata Parvati was taking bath in the Gauri Kund. The Day 2 Parikrama of Mount Kailash is 22km long from Dirapuk to Zuthulphuk. After a 6km trek, we reach the highest point of the Kailash Parikrama which is Dolma La Pass. Just 100-200 meters ahead of Dolma La Pass, on your right, is the Gauri Kund. Since there is no walking track to reach Gauri Kund, you can&rsquo;t go yourself to take water from the Gauri Kund. However, you can give some extra amount to the Sherpa who will get the water for you to take with you.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is there any possibility that one can be stopped from doing Kailash Parvat Kora?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most of the time Kailash Parvat Kora is allowed. It is the sole decision and responsibility of the Tibetan guide whether Mount Kailash Parikrama will be done or not. In case of bad weather such as rainfall or snowfall, the guide permits to complete only the first day&rsquo;s parikrama, i.e. up to Dhirapuk and then return to Yam Dwar. If there is snowfall in March and April, then Mount Kailash Parikrama is stopped in May. In case of health issues such as discomfort or a drop in oxygen level, the Tibetan guide doesn&rsquo;t allow the yatri to go for parikrama to avoid any mishap. In case of any casualty, for eg death of a yatri aged 65 years, the guide doesn&rsquo;t permit the parikrama to all the yatries who are aged above 60 (any such age group). It is advisable to follow the instructions of the Tibetan guide as it is for our own benefit.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the fitness and oxygen level required for Mount Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A basic fitness level is required for Mount Kailash Parikrama. Willpower matters more than anything. If you have strong willpower, you will get through it. However, don&rsquo;t be adamant about doing Kailash Parikrama, take this decision at Mansarovar lake after considering your health condition. It is advised not to force yourself to Mount Kailash Parikrama if your willpower and health are not allowing it. It is advisable to consult the guide and he will suggest you according to the situation and prevailing condition.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the highest altitude we reach during Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The 22km Mount Kailash Parikrama distance of the second day is divided into 6km steep, 6 km slope and the remaining 10 km plain. After completing the 6km uphill distance from Dhirapuk, you will reach the Dol Mala pass which is the highest altitude of the Kailash Parikrama. The height of the Dol Mala pass is 5800 meters.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I do only Mount Kailash first-day’s parikrama and come back?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, you can do only the first-day&rsquo;s parikrama and come back. However, the only way to come back is through an ambulance (emergency help). You cannot come back walking as you will not get any transport from Yamdwar to reach your stay in Darchen or Purang Town. The charges for the ambulance service will be about 500 Yuan per person for a drop at Darchen and 1000 Yuan per person for a drop at Purang town.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens in case of rains, or snowfall during Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Being at a high altitude, the Mount Kailash area is a barren land where there is no greenery. Due to this the rain showers last only a few minutes and the land gets dried quickly. The rains do not much affect the Kailash Parikrama. Since the Kailash Yatra happens between May to September which is the summer season, there is generally no snowfall during this time. In case there is any snowfall, then the Kailash Parikrama is stopped. For example, if there is snowfall in March and April, then Parikrama of only Day 1 is allowed and that of Day 2 and 3 is stopped. It is important and a must to carry woollens and raincoats regardless of the month you are going for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the trekking equipment, and other things we need to carry during the Mt. Kailash trek? / What are the important items to carry for Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Good quality walking shoes that you use regularly, a raincoat and a trekking stick which you can buy from the local market (Purang town or Dongba/ Saga) are required for the Mt.

Kailash Parikrama in one day?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"One cannot complete Mt. Kailash parikrama in one day as it is neither allowed nor advisable. The Tibetan authorities have decided on this format of completing the 40km Parikrama distance in 2 and a half days. Trekking is not done at the night. There are 2 staying points, one at Dhirapuk and the other at Zuthulpuk where we have a permanent kitchen set up to facilitate Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can we perform Yagya Puja at Yamdwar?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It is believed that passing through Yamdwar washes away your sins. Yes, you can perform the Yagya puja at Yamdwar only if you are not doing the parikrama of Mt. Kailash because you will have plenty of time in hand. If you are doing the parikrama then time will be limited to cover the first day&rsquo;s 10km trek distance, so if you want you can do a short puja.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where do we stay during Mt. Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The 40km Mt Kailash Parikrama is completed in 2 and a half days in which you cover a 10km distance and reach Dhirapuk on day 1 and you cover a 22km distance and reach Zuthukpuk. Both these places, i.e. Dirapuk and Zuthulphuk have dormitories in which you will be staying. The dormitories will be on multiple sharing but will have separate beds, pillows and blankets for all the yatries. There is a permanent kitchen set up at these places to provide freshly cooked meals to the yatries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are bathing and toilet facilities available during Mount Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Proper bathing facilities are not available during the Parikrama of Mount Kailash. Since the wind that is blowing is fast and cold, so most of the people do not prefer taking a bath during Mount Kailash Parikrama. However, we ensure to provide warm water for fresh n up\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you carry oxygen cylinders in Kailash Parikrama? Why do we need to buy oxygen cylinders? How much does it cost?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Since oxygen cylinders are heavy, it is difficult to carry them in the Kailash parikrama. Hence oxygen cylinders will be available at the base camps- Dhirapuk and Zuthulpuk for emergency purposes. The guide travelling with the group has an oximeter with him to check your oxygen level from time to time. During Mount Kailash Parikrama, the trekking pace of all yatries differs, so practically it is not possible to provide oxygen urgently if needed. Therefore it is advised to compulsorily carry 1-2 portable oxygen cylinders with you during Kailash Parikrama. You can purchase a portable oxygen cylinder from the local market in Tibet - Purang Town (by Heli route) or Dongba/ Saga (by overland route) that will cost Rs. 250 approx.\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I inhale Kapoor (camphor) in Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Quite a lot of people have used Kapoor in Kailash Parikrama, you can try using it.

The chits will be shuffled and you will be picking up the chit in which it will be written which one is your horse. In 2019, the horses along with the porter roughly cost 3500 Yuan which is approx 35000 to 38000 INR. The rate is fixed by the Union and is the same for all. There is no bargaining allowed.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the charges for a pony, and a porter?

Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In case you have booked a pony, then the pony master will also be your porter who will walk by your side.

You need to pay some extra tip to the Tibetan guide who will take you to Charan Sparsh.

Can I go for Ashtapad Darshan?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Parikrama of the inner circle of Mount Kailash is known as Inner Kora (Parikrama). What we do now is Outer Parikrama, i.e. parikrama of the outer circle of Mount Kailash. It is very risky and practically not possible.\n\nAshtapad Darshan is not permitted by the Tibetan Authorities because it is a sensitive area and it could be dangerous for you to go there because stones keep on falling from above. In 2013, a big stone had fallen on a car and the passengers in the car died, hence since then, permission to go for Ashtapad Darshan is not given.\n\nNow it is illegal to go for the Inner Parikrama of Mt. Kailash. Some companies claim that they do Kailash Inner Parikrama Package. Either these companies deny at the last moment or they try to misguide the yatries by taking them somewhere else and claiming it to be the Inner Parikrama and making money out of it. When we go for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, we must ensure that we are ethically right and are following the Law of Land. Doing any illegal activity may put you in big trouble, that too in China.\n\nTrip To Temples also has Kailash Mansarovar Inner Parikrama Package but we do not announce any date or take any registration for the same until and unless it is officially allowed.\n\nFor more details on Inner Parikrama, Kailash Mansarovar Yatra contact us at 8510007751 or visit https://www.triptotemples.com/kailash-mansarovar/kailash-mansarovar-inner-parikrama\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can we try to climb Mt.

The Tibetan Authorities do not allow any sort of mountaineering activity on Holy Kailash Mountain.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can women do Kailash Parikrama in a saree?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Women can wear a saree in Parikrama. However, it is advisable to wear warm and comfortable clothes instead of a saree that properly covers you and protects you from the wind. While doing the parikrama the saree might get stuck in your leg causing you to fall and hurt yourself, so avoid wearing a saree. Salwar suits or trekking pants are comfortable and more popular options for Mount Kailash Parikrama.\n\n\n"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What places do we see in Mount Kailash Parikrama?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"During the two and a half days of Mount Kailash Parikrama, you get to see the following places:-\n\ni) Yamdwar- One of the most prominent attractions of the Kailash Yatra, Yamdwar is the Gate of Salvation.

It is said to be the lake in which Mata Parvati used to take bath and created Lord Ganesha.\n\n\n"}}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Home","item":"https://www.triptotemples.com"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"All About Kailash Mansarovar Yatra","item":"https://www.triptotemples.com/faqs"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"All About Kailash Mansarovar Yatra","item":"https://www.triptotemples.com/faqs/kailash-mansarovar-yatra"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"name":"All About Kailash Mansarovar Yatra","item":"https://www.triptotemples.com/faqs/kailash-mansarovar-yatra/kailash-parikrama?tr=w-900%2Ch-600"}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage","name":"All About Kailash Mansarovar Yatra","description":"Complete detailed information about Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, documentation & preparation","keywords":["Kailash Mansarovar Yatra"," Kailash Yatra"," Lake Mansarovar"," Mt Kailash; Mount Kailash Kailash Temple"],"url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/faqs/kailash-mansarovar-yatra/kailash-parikrama?tr=w-900%2Ch-600"}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"LocalBusiness","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com","name":"Trip To Temples","email":"info@triptotemples.com","telephone":"+91-8510007751","image":"https://www.triptotemples.com/images/logo.png","sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/triptotemples","https://www.instagram.com/triptotemples/","https://www.youtube.com/c/TripToTemples","https://twitter.com/triptotemples","https://in.linkedin.com/company/trip-to-temples"],"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":{"@type":"Country","name":"India"},"streetAddress":"201, JOP Plaza, Sector 18,","addressLocality":"Noida","addressRegion":"Uttar Pradesh","postalCode":"201301"},"priceRange":"Rs.15000-Rs.500000"}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@graph":[{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Home","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Kailash Mansarovar","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/package/kailash-mansarovar"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Adi Kailash","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/package/adi-kailash"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Kailash Mansarovar","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/package/kailash-mansarovar"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Uttarakhand Kailash","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/package/uttarakhand-kailash"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Char Dham","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/package/char-dham"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"Blogs","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/blogs"},{"@type":"SiteNavigationElement","@context":"https://schema.org","name":"News","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com/news"}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https://www.triptotemples.com","name":"Trip To Temples","logo":"https://www.triptotemples.com/images/logo.png","sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/triptotemples","https://www.instagram.com/triptotemples/","https://www.youtube.com/c/TripToTemples","https://twitter.com/triptotemples","https://in.linkedin.com/company/trip-to-temples"],"contactPoint":[{"@type":"ContactPoint","email":"info@triptotemples.com","telephone":"+91-8510007751","contactType":"Customer Service","ContactOption":"Customer Service"}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json"></script><meta name="next-head-count" content="46"/><script src="../../../checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js" async=""></script><script>

Do not be adamant about the parikrama, do it only if your health permits.<br />
Those who do not want to do Kailash Mountain Parikrama stay in Darchen or Purang (per the instructions of the Tibetan Guide) and wait for others to complete the Parikrama of Holy Kailash Parvat.&nbsp;<br />
On the First day of Mount Kailash Parikrama, all the pilgrims go together till Yam Dwar and do the darshan of Mount Kailash and those who are not going ahead return to Darchen or Purang.<br />
On the Second day of Mount Kailash Parikrama, they stay at the given hotel and take rest or get absorbed in the meditation of god.&nbsp;<br />
On the third day, the Mount Kailash Parikrama gets complete and all the yatries meet by 9-10 a.m. and together proceed ahead.<br />
Nowadays, many people who are very sure in advance that they are not going to complete the Parikrama of Shiva Kailash or have a lesser number of days, then they opt for the shortest Kailash Mansarovar Yatra route in just 5 days.<br />

You can cover this distance either on foot or on a pony. The Parikrama starts from Yamdwar - the place from where we get the darshan of Nandi Parvat and Kailash Parvat.<br />
On Day 1, you will be covering 10km from Yamdwar to Dhirapuk. This is the most auspicious day of the Kailash Yatra because Mount Kailash is visible throughout the day. We get the best view of Mount Kailash from Dhirapuk between 2 mountains. We also get to see Silver Kailash at night and Golden Kailash in the morning from Dhirapuk.<br />
On Day 2, you will be covering 22 km from Dhirapuk to Zuthulpuk. The 22km distance is divided into three parts- the first 6 km uphill, the next 6 km downhill and the last 10 km plain. We start early morning by 4 a.m. because the first stretch of 6 km (Dhirapuk to Dol Mala Pass) is the toughest part of Mount Kailash Parikrama and we try to complete it before the sun shines bright. The last 10 km is a beautiful stretch with the Karnali river flowing by the side.<br />
On the last day, you will be covering 8km. It is a plain terrain that gets covered in 2 to 3 hours and with this, the Kailash Parikrama will be completed.</p>

The Day 2 Parikrama of Mount Kailash is 22km long from Dirapuk to Zuthulphuk. After a 6km trek, we reach the highest point of the Kailash Parikrama which is Dolma La Pass. Just 100-200 meters ahead of Dolma La Pass, on your right, is the Gauri Kund. Since there is no walking track to reach Gauri Kund, you can&rsquo;t go yourself to take water from the Gauri Kund. However, you can give some extra amount to the Sherpa who will get the water for you to take with you.</p>

In case of bad weather such as rainfall or snowfall, the guide permits to complete only the first day&rsquo;s parikrama, i.e. up to Dhirapuk and then return to Yam Dwar. If there is snowfall in March and April, then Mount Kailash Parikrama is stopped in May. In case of health issues such as discomfort or a drop in oxygen level, the Tibetan guide doesn&rsquo;t allow the yatri to go for parikrama to avoid any mishap. In case of any casualty, for eg death of a yatri aged 65 years, the guide doesn&rsquo;t permit the parikrama to all the yatries who are aged above 60 (any such age group). It is advisable to follow the instructions of the Tibetan guide as it is for our own benefit.</p>

However, the only way to come back is through an ambulance (emergency help). You cannot come back walking as you will not get any transport from Yamdwar to reach your stay in Darchen or Purang Town. The charges for the ambulance service will be about 500 Yuan per person for a drop at Darchen and 1000 Yuan per person for a drop at Purang town.</p>

Due to this the rain showers last only a few minutes and the land gets dried quickly. The rains do not much affect the Kailash Parikrama. Since the Kailash Yatra happens between May to September which is the summer season, there is generally no snowfall during this time. In case there is any snowfall, then the Kailash Parikrama is stopped. For example, if there is snowfall in March and April, then Parikrama of only Day 1 is allowed and that of Day 2 and 3 is stopped. It is important and a must to carry woollens and raincoats regardless of the month you are going for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.</p>

In 2019, the horses along with the porter roughly cost 3500 Yuan which is approx 35000 to 38000 INR. The rate is fixed by the Union and is the same for all. There is no bargaining allowed.</p>

What we do now is Outer Parikrama, i.e. parikrama of the outer circle of Mount Kailash. It is very risky and practically not possible.</p>

<p>Ashtapad Darshan is not permitted by the Tibetan Authorities because it is a sensitive area and it could be dangerous for you to go there because stones keep on falling from above. In 2013, a big stone had fallen on a car and the passengers in the car died, hence since then, permission to go for Ashtapad Darshan is not given.</p>

<p>Now it is illegal to go for the Inner Parikrama of Mt. Kailash. Some companies claim that they do Kailash Inner Parikrama Package. Either these companies deny at the last moment or they try to misguide the yatries by taking them somewhere else and claiming it to be the Inner Parikrama and making money out of it. When we go for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, we must ensure that we are ethically right and are following the Law of Land. Doing any illegal activity may put you in big trouble, that too in China.</p>

<p>Trip To Temples also has Kailash Mansarovar Inner Parikrama Package but we do not announce any date or take any registration for the same until and unless it is officially allowed.</p>

<p>i) <strong>Yamdwar</strong>- One of the most prominent attractions of the Kailash Yatra, Yamdwar is the Gate of Salvation. It is believed that passing through this gate washes away your sins. This is the point from where Mount Kailash Parikrama starts.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../cdn.triptotemples.com/ImageManager/66bb2637ab080518fcd4e3d6-untitled-design-(18)bfaa.jpg?tr=w-900,h-600" /></p>

<p>ii) <strong>Mount Kailash</strong>- The main motive to go on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is to get the darshan of the Holy Mountain Kailash. It is believed that Mount Kailash is the resting abode of Lord Shiva and his family.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../cdn.triptotemples.com/ImageManager/66bb260cab080518fcd4e3d5-untitled-design-(19)bfaa.jpg?tr=w-900,h-600" /></p>

<p>iii)<strong> Nandi Parvat</strong>- Next to Mount Kailash is the Nandi Parvat. Nandi Ji is believed to be the Vehicle (Vahan) of Lord Shiva, so wherever there is Lord Shiva, Nandi Ji will be there. The Nandi Parvat is a mountain in the shape of Nandi Ji.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="kailash-parikramabfaa.html?tr=w-900,h-600" /></p>

<p>iv) <strong>Dhirapuk</strong>- After completing the first day of Parikrama of Mount Kailash we reach Dhirapuk. It is the place that gives the most beautiful view of Mount Kailash between two other mountains. One can spot the Golden Kailash in the morning from this point.</p>

<p>v) <strong>Shiva Sthal</strong>- On the second day of Mount Kailash Parikrama, we get to see Shiva Sthal which is the place where people donate clothes and ornaments as it said that if you donate something at Shivasthal, you will get it in your next life.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="kailash-parikramabfaa.html?tr=w-900,h-600" /></p>

<p>vi) <strong>Dolma La Pass</strong>- This is the highest point of the Kailash Parikrama which is situated at an elevation of 6800 meters above sea level. You get to visit Dolma La pass on the second day of Mount Kailash Parikrama.</p>

<p>vii) <strong>Gaurikund</strong>- It is a perfectly round-shaped lake just ahead of Dolma La Pass and is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ganesha. It is said to be the lake in which Mata Parvati used to take bath and created Lord Ganesha.</p>
